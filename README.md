# Mixin

This is an annotation processor to mix Java or Kotlin Classes up into a single Class. 

This is also a sample of [X Processing](https://androidx.tech/artifacts/room/room-compiler-processing/) which is an abstract layer of apt and ksp.

## Usage

The design of this project is very straightforward.

Suppose I have two api classes for User:

```kotlin
class UserApi {
    fun getName(id: Long): String = TODO()

    fun getAge(id: Long): Int = TODO()
}
```

```java
public class GitHubUserApi {
    public String getGitHubUrl(long id) {
        throw new NotImplementedError();
    }

    public int getRepositoryCount(long id) {
        throw new NotImplementedError();
    }
}
```

and I want to combine them into a single class `UserApis`, I will annotate these two classes with `@Mixin`:

```kotlin
@Mixin("com.bennyhuo.kotlin.mixin.sample", "UserApis")
class UserApi { 
    ... 
}
```

```java
@Mixin(packageName = "com.bennyhuo.kotlin.mixin.sample", name = "UserApis")
public class GitHubUserApi {
    ...
}
```

with apt or ksp, `com.bennyhuo.kotlin.mixin.sample.UserApis` will be generated: 

```java
package com.bennyhuo.kotlin.mixin.sample;

import com.bennyhuo.kotlin.mixin.sample.library1.UserApi;
import com.bennyhuo.kotlin.mixin.sample.library2.GitHubUserApi;
import java.lang.String;
import org.jetbrains.annotations.NotNull;

public class UserApis {
  private final UserApi userApi;

  private final GitHubUserApi gitHubUserApi;

  public UserApis() {
    userApi = new UserApi();
    gitHubUserApi = new GitHubUserApi();
  }

  public int getRepositoryCount(long id) {
    return gitHubUserApi.getRepositoryCount(id);
  }

  public String getGitHubUrl(long id) {
    return gitHubUserApi.getGitHubUrl(id);
  }

  @NotNull("")
  public String getName(long id) {
    return userApi.getName(id);
  }

  public int getAge(long id) {
    return userApi.getAge(id);
  }
}
```

That's it. 

It is pretty useful in some cases. 

For example, the JavaScript bridge for Android WebView. You may want to separate different bridge functions into different modules and add them to the WebView as one bridge object, so you have to write a wrapper class in the main module to assemble all the bridge functions. With this library, you can easily achieve that.

## Set up your project

The basic settings is shown as below:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.6.0-1.0.1" // ksp
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt") // kapt
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    google() 
}

dependencies {
    ksp("com.bennyhuo.kotlin:mixin-compiler:1.6.0.1") // ksp
    kapt("com.bennyhuo.kotlin:mixin-compiler:1.6.0.1") // kapt
    implementation("com.bennyhuo.kotlin:mixin-annotations:1.6.0.1")
}
```

### Multi-modules 

If you want to mix class files from different modules, you should configure some of them as 'library' to generate index. 

For example, we have 

* an `Api0.java` in module `a`
* an `Api1.kt` in module `b`
* an `ApiMain.kt` in module `main` 

and want to generate the mixed class `Api.java` into module `main`, we should add an argument `mixin.library` to module `a` and `b` in their build.gradle.kts files:

```kotlin
// for kapt
kapt {
    arguments {
        arg("mixin.library", "true")
    }
}

// for ksp
ksp {
    arg("mixin.library", "true")
}
```

The default value is false, so that mixed classes are generated by default.
